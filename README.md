# ToggleDropdown

This was created for work to toggle dropdowns on a page behind a login.  THe website has an issue where the dropdown selection doesnt alwyas register, so I created a loop to ensure all of the dropdowns were changed.  After the last dropdown has been changed an error is thrown, that error is used to exit the loop and move to the cleanup phase of the code.  

I redacted the website.
